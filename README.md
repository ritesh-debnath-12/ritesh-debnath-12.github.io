# Portfolio
Thanks for finding the time to visit the source code of my portfolio!
This is my personal portfolio built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It showcases my projects, skills, and experience as a developer.
Feel free to explore the code and learn more about my work!


What else can I say....
Did you know that you can make a very nice cup of tea?
- Add the tea leaves(first-flush for the best flavor) while the water is boiling.
- Add it **slowly** lest Poseidon himself manifest in your teapot(or whatever crockery you are using)
- Lid it up and then turn off the heat.
- As for how much to add...follow your heart.

## For my eyes!
Repository specific notes and instructions can be found in docs/ folder, or [just click this](docs/DETAILS.md).
